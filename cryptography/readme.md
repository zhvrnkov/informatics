# Foundations of cryptography
Symmetric cryptography: one key for encryption and decrption (total 1 key)

Asymmetric cryptography: one key for encryption and another for decryption (total 2 keys)

Ceaser cipher: key = number. just add the number to the plaint text % alphabet size

Vigenere cipher: key = text. ctext = (ptext[i] + key[i % key.length]) % alphabet.size

Engigma cipher: ???

Kerckhoffsâ€™s Principle: the algorithm is known, only the key is in secret

Randomness: ???

Entropy: ???
