1 librarian per 20 farmers
1 : 20 = librarian : farmers
1/21 = % of librarians
20/21 = % of farmers

if we got 210 peoples
and pick a random human
then human is:
~95% farmer
~5%  librarian

10 shy farmers per 90 not shy farmers
10% of farmers are shy
90% of farmers not shy

40 shy librarians per 60 not shy librarians
40% of librarians are shy
60% of librarians not shy

back to 210 peoples:
P(L) = P(picking librarian) = 0.05
P(F) = P(picking farmer)    = 0.95

among 210 peoples there are
P(L) * 0.4 + P(F) * 0.1 shy peoples
